# Snapgene Reader in Rust

This project is still in development. It is currently able parse the Cookie and Sequence packets, but still a bit on the rough side for actually parsing the entire file. 

## TODO

- [ ] Read other packet types
- [ ] Allow any order of reading packet types (as the order of packets is not set in stone)
- [ ] Finish other parsers (Notes, Features, Primers)
